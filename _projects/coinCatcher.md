<p class="pink-border">Are you ready to challenge the monsters at a coin gathering game? In this a game you are playing as a robot whose goal is to gather as many raining coins as possible. The game was created as a final project of the MOOC Programming course. Only given images (hirvio.png, kolikko.png, ovi.png and robo.png) were allowed to use and everything else should be created using Python.</p>

## Technologies

- Python
- Pygame

## Learning

### Pygame
In this project, I learned to use Python's game library, Pygame, and create simple game graphics with it.

### Scheduling
I gained experience in scheduling independent work and managing a project, as the course was entirely self-directed. I completed the game according to my schedule with excellent results.
