A user can register to the site to save their favourite locations and set reminders for visits to those locations. The app is a convenient place for all dog owners to find nearby and fun places to visit with their dogs.</p>

## Learning

### My Responsibilities
During the course, I primarily focused on backend development, including implementing functions and tests for the user class, basic user authentication, and user account modification features. After the course had ended, I also refactored the frontend, with the changes visible in the GitHub history.

### Web App Architechture
The application consists of a separate GraphQL API server, a REST authentication server, a frontend, and a NoSQL database. Data is transferred using functions such as fetch and HTTP requests, and the database connection to MongoDB is established using Mongoose.

### Deploying on Azure
I have deployed the project to Azure, which gave me experience in the basic use of Azure and migrating an application to the cloud. The deployment was carried out with the help of GitHub Actions and the necessary environment variables were configured for each part of the software, both in Azure and GitHub.
