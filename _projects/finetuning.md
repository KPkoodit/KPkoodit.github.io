<p class="pink-border">The objective of the thesis was to finetune Stable Diffusion to generate recognizable African violets and their various characteristics. First, we explore the theory behind latent diffusion models and the technologies they rely on. Then, in the practical part, we prepare the dataset, perform finetuning, and test the model using basic image generation methods. The finetuned model successfully generates recognizable African violets and some of their features, but certain characteristics still need further improvement. </p>
