<p class="pink-border">This is a portfolio created using Jekyll's default Ruby gem, Minima. The layout has been heavily modified from a blog to a portfolio, which allowed me to explore both Ruby gems and Jekyll's functionality.</p>

## Learning

### Jekyll Theme Customization
I created new collections and layouts, allowing me to modify Minima to function as a portfolio. Collections are a way to store related data in one place. For a portfolio, for example, projects belong to the same collection. To ensure that Jekyllâ€™s components work as intended, all parts must be located in the correct places within the file structure and properly defined in the config file.

### Code Refactoring and Debugging
Of course, a coding portfolio needs some actual code, right? Many of the projects here required some rework and spaghetti code cleanup before being added, as they were practice projects completed under time constraints. While working on them, I realized that I enjoy improving existing code to enhance its clarity and functionality.
